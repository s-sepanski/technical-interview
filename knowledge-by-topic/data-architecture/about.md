# Data Architecture

## Centralized vs Decentralized vs Federated

### Centralized 
All data in one platform

#### Pros
- Greater economies of scale
- Centralized accountability and control

### Decentralized
Loosely defined principles. There may not be cross-program alignment about data management

### Federated
Different domain experts responsible for different aspects of data. Hybrid of Centralized and Decentralized models

#### Pros
- Reduces bottlenecks/constraints of having all knowledge on one team
