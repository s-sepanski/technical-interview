# Prompt Engineering Relevant to AIF-C01 Exam
## Improved Prompting Techniques
Improved prompting techniques:
- instructions - a task for the model to do (description, how the model should perform)
- context - external information to guide the model
- input data - the input for which you want a response
- output indicator - the output type or format

## Assorted Prompting Techniques

### Negative Prompting
A technique where you explicitly instructh the model on what NOT to include or do in its response

Negative prompting helps to:
- avoid unwanted context
- maintain focus
- enhance clarity 

## Prompt Performance Optimization
System prompts - how the model should behave and reply

Temperature (0 to 1) - creativity of the model's output:
  - low (eg 0.2) - outputs are more conserfvative, repetative, and focused on the most likely response 
  - high (eg 1.0) - outputs are more diverse, creative, and unpredictable, maybe less coherent
