# Guardrails
Guardrails:
- control the interaction between users and FMs
- can filter undesirable and/or harmful content
- can remove PII
- can enhance privacy
- can reduce hallucinations
You can monitor and analyze user inputs that violate the guardrails

You can provide a custom message to display if a guardrail is triggered, eg 'sorry, cannot respond'

It is possible to always not display information that matches a certain regex pattern
