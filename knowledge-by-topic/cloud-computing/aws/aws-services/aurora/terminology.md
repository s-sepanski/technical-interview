# Terminology

- ACU - Aurora Capacity Unit. One ACU is roughly equivalent to 2 GB of memory. You are charged based on the # of ACUs you use. The number of ACUs determines the amount of memory and processing power available to your database. 
  - Scaling: Aurora Serverless v2 allows you to specify a minimum and maximum number of ACUs for your database cluster. The database will then automatically scale its capacity up or down within this range, based on the workload.
