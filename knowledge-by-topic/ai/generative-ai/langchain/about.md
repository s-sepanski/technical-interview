# LangChain
- Features
  - Wraps LLMs: foundation model agnostic (you get api key to any fm and use that as variable in your code)
  - Prompt templates
  - Chains
  - Agents
  - Chain vs Agent: diff between chain and agent is that in chain you tell it what to do next, whereas an agent reasons to decide what to do next
