# RAG (Reference-Augmented Generation)

## When to Fine-Tune a Model (Create a Custom Model) vs When to Use RAG?

Deciding between fine-tuning a model and using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) depends on your use case, the nature of your data, performance needs, and cost constraints. Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown of when to use each:

‚úÖ 
Use Fine-Tuning When:
You need the model to learn patterns or behaviors not captured in the base model.

Example: Specific tone, writing style, or response format.

Use case: A customer support chatbot that mimics your brand‚Äôs voice exactly.

Your task is narrow, repetitive, and doesn‚Äôt require frequent updates.

Example: Classifying legal documents into predefined categories.

Use case: Sentiment analysis or medical code generation.

You don‚Äôt need to reference a changing external knowledge base.

Example: Translating technical jargon consistently or generating personalized recommendations from fixed profiles.

Latency and efficiency matter.

Once fine-tuned, a model runs without needing to hit a database or vector store.

You want to avoid giving the model access to external data (privacy/security).

Ideal for environments with strict data access constraints.

‚úÖ 
Use RAG When:
Your data changes often or is too large to fit into a model.

Example: A news summarizer that pulls from live articles.

Use case: Chatbot that answers from a dynamic product FAQ or document database.

You need the model to answer from external, specific, or proprietary knowledge.

Example: Legal Q&A pulling from firm-specific contracts.

Use case: Internal documentation assistant.

You want high interpretability and easier updates.

You can improve answers by updating the documents or retrieval system ‚Äî no need to retrain.

You want to reduce cost and training time.

RAG avoids the heavy compute and time demands of fine-tuning.

You care about source attribution or transparency.

RAG allows you to trace outputs back to specific documents.

üß† TL;DR Rule of Thumb:
| Need                         | RAG                                   | Fine-Tuning        |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Specific style/behavior      | ‚ùå                                    | ‚úÖ                 |
| High interpretability        | ‚úÖ                                    | ‚ùå                 |
| Task-specific learning       | ‚ùå                                    | ‚úÖ                 |
| Fast iteration with data     | ‚úÖ                                    | ‚ùå                 |
| Minimal latency & compactness| ‚ùå (retrieval adds latency)           | ‚úÖ                 |


If you‚Äôre ever unsure, RAG is usually the safer and more flexible starting point, especially for real-world applications where knowledge needs to be kept fresh. Fine-tuning is better when you have stable data and specific output requirements.
