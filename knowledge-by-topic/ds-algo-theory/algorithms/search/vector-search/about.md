# Vector Search
Vector search is a technique used to find items (such as documents, images, or data points) that are most similar to a given query, based on their vector representations. In this context, each item is represented as a high-dimensional vector (a list of numbers), often generated using machine learning models.

Instead of searching for exact matches (like traditional SQL queries), vector search finds items whose vectors are closest to the query vector, typically using distance metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. This is especially useful for AI applications such as:

Semantic search (finding documents with similar meaning)
Image or audio similarity search
Recommendation systems
