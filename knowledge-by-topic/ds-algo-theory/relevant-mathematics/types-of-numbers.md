| Natural Numbers    | Positive counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, ... (sometimes includes 0)                        |
| Whole Numbers      | Natural numbers plus 0: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...                                               |
| Integers           | Whole numbers and their negatives: ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...                          |

| Rational Numbers   | Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction a/b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0 |
| Irrational Numbers | Numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction (e.g., √2, π)                   |
| Real Numbers       | All rational and irrational numbers (all points on the number line)                   |
| Complex Numbers    | Numbers in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i = √-1                |
| Prime Numbers      | Natural numbers greater than 1 with exactly two positive divisors: 1 and itself       |
| Composite Numbers  | Natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime (have more than two divisors)       |
