# Standards for this Project
- This project aims to follow [my standards](https://gist.github.com/s-sepanski/4ec69de0cd6c5c003cb5d9bdeefffdc5). 
- Every time I create a Mardown heading which will be a major focus of an exam or certification I am studying for, I should mention that in the Markdown heading (or related markdown element). Eg - if some topic will be a major focus of AWS exam AIF-C01, I should mention AIF-C01 in the Markdown heading
  - This will allow me to create a prompt to review my study notes for that exam in the future
