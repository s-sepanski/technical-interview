s-sepanski: I am a software engineer studying for leetcode interviews, and you are an elite neuroscience professor and an instructor of the Coursera course "Learning How to Learn". Describe how I can use spaced repeition to study leetcode problems. Should I have a different review routine for problems I struggle with? Describe the specific algorithm of how I should review problems, based on whether I do or do not struggle with those problems. Suppose I work a new problem each week. If I have a long backlog of problems that I struggle with, which problems should I prioritize reviewing?

GitHub Copilot: Spaced repetition is a powerful technique for long-term retention, especially for complex skills like LeetCode problem-solving. Here’s how you can apply it, with neuroscience-backed strategies and practical algorithms:

## 1. Spaced Repetition for LeetCode

- **After solving a problem**, schedule reviews at increasing intervals: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, etc.
- **During each review**, attempt to solve the problem from scratch, not just recall the answer. This strengthens retrieval pathways.

## 2. Different Routines for Struggled vs. Mastered Problems

### For Problems You Struggle With:
- **Shorter intervals**: Review after 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 7 days, 14 days, etc.
- **Active recall**: Write code without looking at the solution. If you fail, review the solution, then try again the next day.
- **Error log**: Note what tripped you up (e.g., algorithm, edge case, syntax) and review these notes during each session.

### For Problems You Mastered:
- **Longer intervals**: Review after 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 60 days, etc.
- If you solve it easily, increase the interval further.
- If you struggle, move it back to the “struggled” schedule.

## 3. Review Algorithm

1. **Tag each problem** as “struggled” or “mastered” after each review.
2. **Maintain a review queue** for each category, with next review dates.
3. **Each day/week**:
   - Review all problems scheduled for today.
   - For “struggled” problems, if you fail, reset the interval to 1 day.
   - For “mastered” problems, if you fail, move it to the “struggled” queue.
4. **When backlog is large**:
   - Prioritize “struggled” problems with the oldest review dates.
   - If time is limited, review the top N “struggled” problems due, then as many “mastered” as possible.

## 4. Backlog Prioritization

- **Always prioritize “struggled” problems** over “mastered” ones.
- Within “struggled,” review those you haven’t seen in the longest time.
- If two are equally overdue, pick the one you failed most recently.

## 5. Example Weekly Routine

- **Monday**: Solve a new problem.
- **Tuesday**: Review yesterday’s problem (active recall). Review any “struggled” problems due.
- **Wednesday**: Review problems due (per schedule).
- **Thursday–Sunday**: Continue reviews as scheduled.
- **End of week**: Reflect on which problems are still “struggled” and adjust intervals.

---

**Summary:**  
Use shorter, more frequent reviews for problems you struggle with, and longer intervals for mastered ones. Always prioritize reviewing “struggled” problems, especially those most overdue. This approach leverages the neuroscience of memory consolidation and retrieval, maximizing your LeetCode learning efficiency.

s-sepanski: Review the schema in #file:problems.md. For that data schema, do the algorithms described above change in any way?

GitHub Copilot: Given the schema in problems.md, the core spaced repetition algorithms described above remain the same, but the schema provides a structured way to implement and automate them. Here’s how the schema affects or enables the algorithms:

### 1. Tracking Struggled vs. Mastered Problems
- The column **"Feel Could Benefit From Review? (Y/N)"** directly maps to whether a problem is “struggled” (Y) or “mastered” (N).
- You can use this column to filter and prioritize problems for review.

### 2. Scheduling Reviews
- The **"Date Solved"** column allows you to calculate when each problem should next be reviewed, based on your spaced repetition intervals.
- You may want to add a new column, e.g., **"Next Review Date"**, to make scheduling explicit, but you can also compute it dynamically.

### 3. Prioritization
- To prioritize, filter for problems with "Y" in the review column, then sort by the oldest "Date Solved" or by the last review date if you add that column.
- The **"Minutes to Solve"** and **"Comment"** columns can help you further prioritize (e.g., focus on problems that took longer or had tricky parts).

### 4. Review Algorithm (Schema-Aware)
- Each review session, filter for problems with "Y" in the review column.
- For each, check if it’s due for review (based on "Date Solved" and your interval).
- After review, update the "Feel Could Benefit From Review?" column to "N" if you now feel confident, or leave as "Y" and update the "Date Solved" to today if you still struggle.
- Optionally, add a "Last Reviewed" or "Next Review Date" column for more precise tracking.

### 5. No Major Algorithmic Change
- The main logic and neuroscience principles remain unchanged.
- The schema simply makes it easier to track, filter, and update your review schedule.

**Summary:**  
The schema in problems.md supports the spaced repetition algorithm by providing fields to track problem status and review needs. You may consider adding a "Next Review Date" or "Last Reviewed" column for even more effective automation, but the core review and prioritization logic does not fundamentally change.

s-sepanski: each row corresponds to a problem that was reviewed on a specific date. if one problem was reviewed on multiple dates, it would have multiple rows

GitHub Copilot: Thank you for clarifying. With this schema—where each row is a review event for a problem on a specific date—the spaced repetition algorithm adapts as follows:

### 1. Tracking Review History
- Each review (attempt) is a new row, so you have a full history of when and how you felt about each problem.
- To determine the current status of a problem (“struggled” or “mastered”), look at the most recent row for that problem.

### 2. Scheduling Next Reviews
- For each problem, use the most recent review date to calculate when it should next be reviewed, based on whether you struggled (“Y”) or not (“N”) in the last review.
- You may want to automate or script this: for each unique problem, find the latest row, check the “Feel Could Benefit From Review?” column, and schedule accordingly.

### 3. Prioritization
- To prioritize, filter for problems whose most recent review was “Y” and sort by the date of that review (oldest first).
- This ensures you focus on “struggled” problems that haven’t been reviewed in the longest time.

### 4. Review Algorithm (with this schema)
- For each review session:
  1. For each unique problem, find the latest review row.
  2. If “Feel Could Benefit From Review?” is “Y” and the next review is due (based on your interval), prioritize it.
  3. After reviewing, add a new row with today’s date and your updated assessment.

### 5. No Major Change to Spaced Repetition Logic
- The core algorithm is unchanged, but this schema gives you a robust audit trail and makes it easy to analyze your progress over time.

**Summary:**  
With each row as a review event, always use the most recent review for each problem to determine its status and next review date. Prioritize “struggled” problems that are most overdue, and add a new row after each review to keep your history complete. This approach is well-suited for spaced repetition and progress tracking.

s-sepanski: Write a python script in a new file named `review-problems.py` which implements this algorithm for input #file:problems.md. As output, the script should print the top three highest priority problems to review, where the highest priority problem to review is number one. If there are less than three problems in #file:problems.md print "insufficient data". Add descriptive comments and write maintainable, modular code. Describe the algorithm and the benefit to the user. Use semantic variable names 

GitHub Copilot: Here’s how the script will work:

**Algorithm Description:**
1. Parse problems.md and extract all review events.
2. For each unique problem, find the most recent review event.
3. Filter for problems where the most recent review has "Feel Could Benefit From Review?" == "Y".
4. Sort these by the most overdue (oldest review date first).
5. Print the top three problems to review, with the highest priority as number one. If there are fewer than three, print "insufficient data".

**Benefit to the User:**
This script helps you focus your review sessions on the problems you struggle with most and have neglected the longest, maximizing the effectiveness of your spaced repetition practice.

I will now create `review-problems.py` with clear, modular code and descriptive comments. 

Made changes.

The script review-problems.py has been created. 

**Algorithm Summary:**
- It parses all review events from problems.md.
- For each problem, it finds the most recent review.
- It filters for problems you still struggle with ("Y" in the review column).
- It sorts these by how long it’s been since you last reviewed them (oldest first).
- It prints the top three highest-priority problems to review, or "insufficient data" if there are fewer than three.

**Benefit:**  
This ensures you focus on the most overdue and most challenging problems, making your review sessions efficient and targeted for maximum learning.

The code is modular, well-commented, and easy to maintain. Let me know if you want to run or further customize the script!

s-sepanski: print 'insufficient data' ONLY for unoccupied priority slots!

GitHub Copilot:

Made changes.

The script has been updated so that it now prints "insufficient data" only for unoccupied priority slots, rather than for the entire result if fewer than three problems are found. Each of the top three slots will be filled with either a problem or "insufficient data" as appropriate.

Let me know if you want to test the script or need further adjustments!

s-sepanski: explain why output:
```
Top 3 problems to review:
insufficient data
insufficient data
insufficient data
```
was given even though #file:problems.md has problem event with problem name `plaintext name of problem`?

GitHub Copilot: The output:
```
Top 3 problems to review:
insufficient data
insufficient data
insufficient data
```
was given because the only row in problems.md is a template/example row, not an actual problem event. Specifically:

- The row contains placeholders like `plaintext name of problem`, `hyperlink to problem`, `YYYY-MM-DD`, and so on.
- The script is designed to recommend real problems for review, but it skips rows that are not valid review events (e.g., rows with placeholder values or missing/invalid dates).
- Since there are no real problem events with actual names, links, and dates, the script finds zero valid problems to review.
- As a result, all three priority slots are unoccupied, so it prints "insufficient data" for each.

**Summary:**  
The output occurs because the file only contains a template/example row, not real data. The script correctly ignores this and reports that there is insufficient data to recommend problems for review.

s-sepanski: ASSUME THAT THE EXISTING PROBLEM EVENT IS REAL DATA

GitHub Copilot: If you assume the existing problem event is real data, the script still outputs:
```
Top 3 problems to review:
insufficient data
insufficient data
insufficient data
```
because the "Date Solved (YYYY-MM-DD)" field contains the placeholder "YYYY-MM-DD", not a valid date.

The script attempts to parse this field as a date. Since "YYYY-MM-DD" is not a valid date, the script skips this row when determining which problems are eligible for review. As a result, it finds zero valid problems and prints "insufficient data" for all three slots.

**How to fix:**  
Replace "YYYY-MM-DD" with a real date (e.g., "2025-05-20"). The script will then recognize the row as valid and include it in the review recommendations.

s-sepanski: validate input data and print helpful user errors in case of invalid or example data

GitHub Copilot: 
````

````


Made changes.

The script now validates input data and prints helpful user errors if it detects example/placeholder data or invalid dates in problems.md. It will clearly indicate which rows need to be fixed and will only proceed with valid problem review data. If no valid data is found, it will prompt you to update your file.

You can now run the script to get clear feedback on any issues with your input data. Let me know if you want to test it or need further enhancements!
